# Frontend Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

Hi everyone,

My name is **Gizem**. I am a **Frontend Developer**, and this repository represents my personal portfolio. It showcases selected projects, skills, and approaches I use while building modern, user-focused web interfaces.

I am currently involved in frontend development, working together with **Süleyman** and **Bahadır** on collaborative projects, and I am continuously improving my skills through real-world implementations.

I’m excited to keep building, learning, and sharing my work. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio 🙌
